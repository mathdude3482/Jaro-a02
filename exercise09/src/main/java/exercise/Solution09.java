Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room.
Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet.
Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.
Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint.
You must round up to the next whole gallon.
